** IEEE UCR 3D Printing Profile **

* Information *
Hello everybody, here is the 3D printing profile for IEEE UCR's Replicator 2.

The profile is tuned for printing with the "Natural" Makerbot filament.
This is purportedly the hardest filament to actually print with.
The theory behind this is that if we can print with the hardest filament to work with, we can print with anything.

* Details *
This profile has supports and raft printing.

The raft is slightly optimized to use less material and has proven mostly necessary to ensure a good print.

Supports are not as optimized but are necessary for good prints.
